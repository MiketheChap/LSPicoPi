# Programming Environment for Teensy

## Language: C++
- Teensy is programmed primarily in C++, not Python
- Uses Arduino-style C++ with some Teensy-specific extensions

## Development Environment
1. Arduino IDE
   - Most common choice
   - Requires Teensyduino add-on

2. PlatformIO
   - More advanced IDE, popular for larger projects
   - Supports Teensy out of the box

3. Visual Studio Code
   - Can be used with PlatformIO extension

## Key Differences from Python
- Statically typed (vs Python's dynamic typing)
- Compiled (not interpreted like Python)
- More verbose syntax
- Direct hardware access
- Potentially faster execution

## Learning Curve
- Steeper than Python for beginners
- Familiar to those with C/C++ or Arduino experience

## Benefits for Audio-Visual Projects
- Fine-grained control over hardware
- Efficient execution, crucial for real-time audio and LED control
- Rich ecosystem of C++ libraries for audio and LED manipulation
